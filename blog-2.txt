Q:How to handle asynchronous operations using async/await over callback/promise TypeScript.

Answer:- Handling Asynchronous Operations in TypeScript with Async/Await
Asynchronous operations in JavaScript such as API calls, file reads, or database queries are handled using callbacks, promises, and async/await. TypeScript makes this process more type-safe.

Disadvantages of Callbacks
Using callbacks often creates callback hell in the code:
getData((data) => {
    processData(data, (result) => {
        saveData(result, () => {
            console.log("Done!");
        });
    });
});

Advantages of Promises
Promises make code a little cleaner:
fetchData()
    .then(data => processData(data))
    .then(result => saveData(result))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));

The Power of Async/Await
Using Async/Await makes code more readable and looks more synchronous.
const fetchAndSave = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        const result = await processData(data);
        await saveData(result);
        console.log("Done!");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
};
Why is Async/Await better?
1) Code is easier to read.
2) Error handling is easy with try/catch.
3) Type checking makes TypeScript easy.
